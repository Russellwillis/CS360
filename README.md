What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
A login screen for the account, and an input, delete, and edit screen to make sure their weights was right.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?\
I just kept on repeating the test to make sure it all worked.(it didnt yet) In progress.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Probably the login screen as that was my biggest issue. Just test and test again to fix it.
